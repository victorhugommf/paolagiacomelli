It’s an easy process:

1. Your customer places an order.
2. You fulfill the order and mark it as completed.
3. After a delay (customizable by you), your customer receives our automated review request email.
4. The customer leaves a review for all of their purchases on our aggregated form. Reviews can include ratings and images to increase trust.
5. The review is exported to WooCommerce and published on your site.

You can even choose to automatically send the customer a discount code for future purchases as a thank you.

=== 💸 Boost Sales – With Extra Features ===

Did you know that displaying reviews can increase conversion by 270%?

Reviews show that people can trust your site. Other people have bought from you before, and it went so well that they want to share their experience. That social proof is important. Customers need to know your product images and descriptions can be trusted. They need to know their bank account is safe.

Turn your visitors into customers by displaying reviews!

Plus, benefit from:

* Enabling customers to attach pictures to reviews
* Preventing spam by enabling reCAPTCHA for reviews
* Showing reviews summary bar on product pages
* Filtering reviews by rating
* Enabling visitors to vote on reviews left by your customers
* Lazy loading of reviews and attached pictures
* Sorting reviews by date or votes
* Review tagging
* Trust Badges that show a summary of verified customer reviews
* Built-in shortcodes to display a responsive list, grid, or slider of reviews on any page or post

=== 🔎 Boost SEO – The Automated Way ===

Google loves something new! Add new content to your site automatically with customer reviews.

Show off review ratings directly in Google searches, and boost your site’s clickthrough rate.

Plus, benefit from:

* Enhancing rich snippets and structured data markup for reviews with pictures
* Enhancing the standard WooCommerce structured data markup with product identifiers (GTIN, MPN, Brand)

=== 😀 Boost Engagement – With Better Feedback ===

Customers believe that only 8% of companies deliver a great experience – but that can change!

Use reviews to get direct feedback from your customers. Find out the good and bad parts of their experience.

You can make business decisions based on the feedback you receive and keep your customers happy.

Plus, benefit from:

* Receiving feedback for multiple products at once with aggregated review forms
* Personalized email templates
* Enabling customers to vote on past reviews

=== 🚀 Boost Loyalty – Grow Your Repeat Business ===

Market to your existing customers!

It’s simple: our review reminders keep you in the forefront of their minds, and offering coupon codes for future purchases gets them back to your store.

It’s easy for a customer to leave a review and receive their coupon, which creates a double whammy effect: the customer comes back for more, and you gain valuable feedback. Maybe they’ll even gift the voucher to a friend!

Plus, benefit from:

* Automatically generating new coupons for ongoing customer reviews
* Fair rules for coupon creation – customers will be awarded with a coupon regardless of how positive or negative their review is
* Automatic emails with coupons upon review submission
* Personalizing emails with coupons for each customer using built-in variables
* Fine-tuning coupon properties according to your sales strategy

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I found a bug in the plugin. How to get it fixed? =

Please create a new topic at the support forum and provide detailed information with a screenshot.

= How to get Site Key and Secret Key for reCAPTCHA? =

Please visit [reCAPTCHA website](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/start) and sign up for an account. Then, you will be able to get API key pair (Site Key and Secret Key) for your website. Copy these keys and paste into the settings of the plugin.

= Will collected reviews be shown as stars in Google? =

The standard WooCommerce functionality already includes structured data mark up to display your product reviews effectively within organic search results. This plugin extends the standard functionality and adds some extra mark up to help search engines properly crawl your shop. It is important to understand that having a valid structured data mark up in place makes your website eligible for organic stars in Google but it doesn't guarantee that they will be shown. You can test the rich snippets using [Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool).

= How to customize template of the reviews on a single product page? =
The plugin uses the standard reviews template provided by WooCommerce and enhances it with the reviews summary bar. If your theme requires a customized reviews template or you would like to use a customized reviews template for some other reason, it is possible to do so. Here is how to do it:
1) Create a folder 'customer-reviews-woocommerce' in your current theme's folder.
2) Copy file 'ivole-single-product-reviews.php' from 'templates' subfolder in the plugin's folder to the folder created at step 1.
3) Customize the file 'ivole-single-product-reviews.php' in the current theme's folder according to your requirements.

= How to Change Sorting of Reviews? =
If you would like to change how reviews are sorted on product pages, it is possible to do so using the standard WordPress functionality. Go to Settings -> Discussion menu and find options “Break comments into pages with X top level comments per page and the last/first page displayed by default” and “Comments should be displayed with the older/newer comments at the top of each page”. You can control how reviews are sorted and displayed on product pages by modifying these options.
